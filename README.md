The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle in mathematics and computer science. It involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens can attack each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

The main goal is to find all the possible ways to arrange N queens on the board, ensuring they don't threaten each other. The problem is often solved using backtracking, a technique that incrementally builds solutions and abandons them if they prove invalid.

The N-Queens problem helps in understanding algorithm design and optimization techniques, and it's also a fun and challenging exercise for those interested in puzzles and logic.
